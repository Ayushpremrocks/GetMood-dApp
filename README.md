This project is made by me for Finance & Economics Club, IIT Guwahati.

Developed a decentralized application (dApp) featuring a user-friendly frontend website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
enabling users to interact with a Solidity smart contract deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet for managing moods.

Leveraged cutting-edge technologies such as Ethers.js library, MetaMask wallet, Remix IDE, Node.js and Lite-Server,
ensuring seamless integration between frontend and deployed smart contract.
