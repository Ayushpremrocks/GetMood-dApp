This project is made my me for Finance & Economics Club, IIT Guwahati.
For the project, I build a decentralized application on Ethereum using HTML, CSS, Javascript and solidity.
We used MetaMask, Remix IDE, and Ethers.js for this project.
At the end, we create a simple frontend interface that can interact with smart contract functions by only using two simple buttons.
